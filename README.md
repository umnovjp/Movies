# Movie Reviews

We created this website for a user to search for movies by year or genre. First, a user has to enter year. default is set to 2021.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88174852/151253651-469a348f-3077-4847-8972-bd2e85603c4b.png)

As I enter 2018 and hit family button, a list of 5 family movies is populated. It includes title, film director, actors, rating and plot.

And as I hit OMDB Family button, list of 5 comedies shows up. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88174852/151254611-d657d619-ea8f-4dd6-ae18-248ffef64ba8.png)
I can click genre in the side bar to navigate to different genre. And when I click rent me on RedHat or buy me at Amazon buttons, I am forwarded to their websites.

## Technical criteria
This app uses two external APIs. One is https://data-imdb1.p.rapidapi.com/, It responds with list of movie titles only as I search by year and genre. And another API http://www.omdbapi.com/ shows me director, actors, plot, rating as I search by title. We used Figma (not bootstrap) to create page frame. It is interactive, as it can accept year. It does not use alerts. It is responsive. It has polished UI and high-quality README fila that you are reading. 

## Links
Original project page is here: https://github.com/JohnPaulGeorgeRingo. But our team was understaffed during actual project 1. Not every feature was working. And we were not able to revive the page after that because it was locked. So I just cloned that repo and updated. New GitHub link is https://github.com/umnovjp/Movies/, New live link is https://umnovjp.github.io/Movies/. Live link is not fully operational as i writes this text. Here is error message related to GitHub policies.
I am looking for a way around. Presentation was made during the class. Watch video here: https://bootcampspot.com/sessions/1744470/videos/142254.
